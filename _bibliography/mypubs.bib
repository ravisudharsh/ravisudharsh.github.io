   abstract = {Extra-cellular accumulation of Amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques is causatively associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, mechanisms that mediate the pre-pathological state of amyloid plaque formation remain elusive. Here, using paired RNAi and kinase inhibitor screens, we discovered that AKT-mediated insulin/nutrient signaling suppresses lysosomal clearance of Aβ and promotes amyloid formation. This mechanism is cell-autonomous and functions in multiple systems, including iPSC-derived human neurons and in vivo. Nutrient signaling regulates amyloid formation via distinct lysosomal functional mechanisms, while enhanced amino acid signaling promotes amyloid formation by transcriptionally suppressing lysosome biogenesis, and high intracellular cholesterol levels suppress lysosomal clearance of amyloid by increasing the number of non-functional lysosomes. The nutrient signaling pathway, present in both neurons and microglia, regulates lysosomal clearance of amyloid and microglia mediated synapse loss, both in vitro and in vivo. Clinically, older hyperlipidemic patients showed less synapse loss through microglia and performed better in cognitive tests. Thus, our results reveal a bi-partite cellular quality control system regulated by the insulinnutrient signaling that in neurons regulates Aβ peptide clearance and in microglia regulates synaptic loss, both processes causally associated with AD. Our results also caution against reducing amyloid through such processes as this might also result in synapse loss.},

   abstract = {Diverse manifestations of biological aging often reflect disparities in socioeconomic status (SES). In this paper, we examine associations between indicators of SES and an mRNA-based aging signature during young adulthood, before clinical indications of aging are common. We use data from wave V (2016-2018) of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, a nationally representative study of adults aged 33-43 years, with transcriptomic data from a subset of 2,491 participants. Biological aging is measured using 1) a composite transcriptomic aging signature previously identified by Peters et al.'s out-of-sample meta-analysis (Nat Commun. 2015;6:8570) and 2) 9 subsets that represent functional pathways of coexpressed genes. SES refers to income, education, occupation, subjective social status, and a composite measure combining these 4 dimensions. We examine hypothesized mechanisms through which SES could affect aging: body mass index, smoking, health insurance status, difficulty paying bills, and psychosocial stress. We find that SES - especially the composite measure and income - is associated with transcriptomic aging and immune, mitochondrial, ribosomal, lysosomal, and proteomal pathways. Counterfactual mediational models suggest that the mediators partially account for these associations. The results thus reveal that numerous biological pathways associated with aging are already linked to SES in young adulthood.},

   abstract = {Disparities in socio-economic status (SES) predict many immune system-related diseases, and previous research documents relationships between SES and the immune cell transcriptome. Drawing on a bioinformatically-informed network approach, we situate these findings in a broader molecular framework by examining the upstream regulators of SES-associated transcriptional alterations. Data come from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), a nationally representative sample of 4543 adults in the United States. Results reveal a network—of differentially expressed genes, transcription factors, and protein neighbors of transcription factors—that shows widespread SES-related dysregulation of the immune system. Mediational models suggest that body mass index (BMI) plays a key role in accounting for many of these associations. Overall, the results reveal the central role of upstream regulators in socioeconomic differences in the molecular basis of immunity, which propagate to increase risk of chronic health conditions in later-life.},

   abstract = {Many common chronic diseases of aging are negatively associated with socioeconomic status (SES). This study examines whether inequalities can already be observed in the molecular underpinnings of such diseases in the 30s, before many of them become prevalent. Data come from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), a large, nationally representative sample of US subjects who were followed for over two decades beginning in adolescence. We now have transcriptomic data (mRNA-seq) from a random subset of 4,543 of these young adults. SES in the household-of-origin and in young adulthood were examined as covariates of a priori-defined mRNA-based disease signatures and of specific gene transcripts identified de novo. An SES composite from young adulthood predicted many disease signatures, as did income and subjective status. Analyses highlighted SES-based inequalities in immune, inflammatory, ribosomal, and metabolic pathways, several of which play central roles in senescence. Many genes are also involved in transcription, translation, and diverse signaling mechanisms. Average causal-mediated effect models suggest that body mass index plays a key role in accounting for these relationships. Overall, the results reveal inequalities in molecular risk factors for chronic diseases often decades before diagnoses and suggest future directions for social signal transduction models that trace how social circumstances regulate the human genome.},

@article{Parmentier2022,
   abstract = {When human cord blood–derived CD34+ cells are induced to differentiate, they undergo rapid and dynamic morphological and molecular transformations that are critical for fate commitment. In particular, the cells pass through a transitory phase known as “multilineage-primed” state. These cells are characterized by a mixed gene expression profile, different in each cell, with the coexpression of many genes characteristic for concurrent cell lineages. The aim of our study is to understand the mechanisms of the establishment and the exit from this transitory state. We investigated this issue using single-cell RNA sequencing and ATAC-seq. Two phases were detected. The first phase is a rapid and global chromatin decompaction that makes most of the gene promoters in the genome accessible for transcription. It results 24 h later in enhanced and pervasive transcription of the genome leading to the concomitant increase in the cell-to-cell variability of transcriptional profiles. The second phase is the exit from the multilineage-primed phase marked by a slow chromatin closure and a subsequent overall down-regulation of gene transcription. This process is selective and results in the emergence of coherent expression profiles corresponding to distinct cell subpopulations. The typical time scale of these events spans 48 to 72 h. These observations suggest that the nonspecificity of genome decompaction is the condition for the generation of a highly variable multilineage expression profile. The nonspecific phase is followed by specific regulatory actions that stabilize and maintain the activity of key genes, while the rest of the genome becomes repressed again by the chromatin recompaction. Thus, the initiation of differentiation is reminiscent of a constrained optimization process that associates the spontaneous generation of gene expression diversity to subsequent regulatory actions that maintain the activity of some genes, while the rest of the genome sinks back to the repressive closed chromatin state.},

   abstract = {Genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) provide a powerful framework for simulating the entire set of biochemical reactions in a cell using a constraint-based modeling strategy called flux balance analysis (FBA). FBA relies on an assumed metabolic objective for generating metabolic fluxes using GEMs. But, the most appropriate metabolic objective is not always obvious for a given condition and is likely context-specific, which often complicate the estimation of metabolic flux alterations between conditions. Here, we propose a new method, called ΔFBA (deltaFBA), that integrates differential gene expression data to evaluate directly metabolic flux differences between two conditions. Notably, ΔFBA does not require specifying the cellular objective. Rather, ΔFBA seeks to maximize the consistency and minimize inconsistency between the predicted flux differences and differential gene expression. We showcased the performance of ΔFBA through several case studies involving the prediction of metabolic alterations caused by genetic and environmental perturbations in Escherichia coli and caused by Type-2 diabetes in human muscle. Importantly, in comparison to existing methods, ΔFBA gives a more accurate prediction of flux differences.},

   abstract = {To uncover underlying mechanisms associated with failure of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) blockade in clinical trials, we conducted a pilot, window-of-opportunity clinical study in 17 patients with newly diagnosed advanced high-grade serous ovarian cancer before their standard tumor debulking surgery. Patients were treated with the IDO1 inhibitor epacadostat, and immunologic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic characterization of the tumor microenvironment was undertaken in baseline and posttreatment tumor biopsies. IDO1 inhibition resulted in efficient blockade of the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan degradation and was accompanied by a metabolic adaptation that shunted tryptophan catabolism toward the serotonin pathway. This resulted in elevated nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), which reduced T cell proliferation and function. Because NAD+ metabolites could be ligands for purinergic receptors, we investigated the impact of blocking purinergic receptors in the presence or absence of NAD+ on T cell proliferation and function in our mouse model. We demonstrated that A2a and A2b purinergic receptor antagonists, SCH58261 or PSB1115, respectively, rescued NAD+-mediated suppression of T cell proliferation and function. Combining IDO1 inhibition and A2a/A2b receptor blockade improved survival and boosted the antitumor immune signature in mice with IDO1 overexpressing ovarian cancer. These findings elucidate the downstream adaptive metabolic consequences of IDO1 blockade in ovarian cancers that may undermine antitumor T cell responses in the tumor microenvironment.},

We have previously modeled amyloid-beta (Ab)-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in a transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans strain by expressing human Ab peptide specifically in neurons (GRU102). Here, we focus on the deeper metabolic changes associated with this Ab-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Integrating metabolomics, transcriptomics and computational modeling, we identify alterations in Tricarboxylic Acid (TCA) cycle metabolism following even low-level Ab expression. In particular, GRU102 showed reduced activity of a rate-limiting TCA cycle enzyme, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. These defects were associated with elevation of protein carbonyl content specifically in mitochondria. Importantly, metabolic failure occurred before any significant increase in global protein aggregate was detectable. Treatment with an anti-diabetes drug, Metformin, reversed Ab-induced metabolic defects, reduced protein aggregation and normalized lifespan of GRU102. Our results point to metabolic dysfunction as an early and causative event in Ab-induced pathology and a promising target for intervention.},

   abstract = {Understanding the emerging models of adaptive resistance is key to overcoming cancer chemotherapy failure. Using human breast cancer explants, in vitro cell lines, mouse in vivo studies and mathematical modelling, here we show that exposure to a taxane induces phenotypic cell state transition towards a favoured transient CD44HiCD24Hi chemotherapy-tolerant state. This state is associated with a clustering of CD44 and CD24 in membrane lipid rafts, leading to the activation of Src Family Kinase (SFK)/hemopoietic cell kinase (Hck) and suppression of apoptosis. The use of pharmacological inhibitors of SFK/Hck in combination with taxanes in a temporally constrained manner, where the kinase inhibitor is administered post taxane treatment, but not when co-administered, markedly sensitizes the chemotolerant cells to the chemotherapy. This approach of harnessing chemotherapy-induced phenotypic cell state transition for improving antitumour outcome could emerge as a translational strategy for the management of cancer. Adaptive resistance is an emerging cause of chemotherapy failure in cancer. Here the authors show that adaptive resistance to taxanes is mediated by the upregulation of SFK/Hck survival signalling, and that sequential administration of taxanes and SFK/Hck inhibition restores tumor cell chemosensitivity.},
