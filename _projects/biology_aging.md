Aging is a complex and multifactorial process that causes progressive functional decline and decreased ability of an organism to respond to stress. Aging affects almost all organisms on earth, albeit at varying rates. Even within an organism, the rate of functional decline could also differ among tissues. The aging process is characterized by a gradual loss of function that results in increased morbidity and ultimately culminates in death. Although aging is typically not considered a disease, it is a major risk factor is a plethora of human diseases with widely varying pathologies. The rapid greying of the world population carries significant socioeconomic impacts, especially in developed countries. Without a concomitant or faster increase in the length of healthy life, an extension of human lifespan would translate to higher health care spending. A better understanding of the biology of ageing has the potential to delay the onset of age-related diseases, extend healthy life expectancy, and thus reduce the socioeconomic burden of a greying population.

This study examines the aging transcriptomic signatures from over seven hundred individuals from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. Our findings show that the human aging transcriptomic signatures are associated with the conserved hallmarks of aging postulated from numerous research efforts in model organisms. In further inspecting the relative importance of the age-associated genes, we unearth a roadmap of events associated with changes in gene expression. Our analyses suggest a pivotal and continual role played by cell fate regulators. Additionally, we identify early metabolic events that precede several organism-wide perturbations observed in older ages. In summary, we identify temporal sequence of events from the analysis of gene expression that could provide valuable and novel insights into the progression of the age-associated decline. These findings could potentially be advantageous in formulating mitigating efforts in age-associated conditions.
