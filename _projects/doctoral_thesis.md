I received my doctoral degree in Chemical and Bioengineering from ETH Zürich, Switzerland under the supervision of [Prof. Rudiyanto Gunawan.](https://engineering.buffalo.edu/chemical-biological/people/faculty-directory/core.host.html/content/shared/engineering/chemical-biological/profiles/faculty/gunawan-rudiyanto.detail.html) Dr. Gunawan's Chemical and Biological Systems Engineering Laboratory (CABSEL) is now at University at Buffalo, New York since 2018. The doctoral work titled, "*Metabolic network analysis and its application in understanding the biology of aging*" focusses on the use of novel bioinformatic tools and workflows designed to predict metabolic and biological perturbations in aging and neurodegenerative disorders with the incorportaion of differential transcriptomic data.
