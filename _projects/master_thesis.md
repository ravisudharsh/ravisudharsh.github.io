Supervised by [Prof. Konrad Hungerbühler](https://master-energy.ethz.ch/people/person-detail.html?persid=78868), I completed my Master thesis at the Safety & Environmental Technology Group at the Institute for Chemical and Bioengineering, ETH Zürich, Switzerland. The thesis titled, "*Reducing Complexity - Efficient Modeling for Biorefinery Concepts*" involved the innovative and integrative biorefinery concept for the production of commerically relevant polymers. Furthermore, with the use of surrogate modeling, we showcase a computer-aided platform for the integration of different bio-based production routes to find the optimal biorefinery concept.
