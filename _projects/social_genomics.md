The Social Genomics research team at the Jacobs Center for Productive Youth Development seeks to investigate the impact of social forces on the genome and subsequently overall health. Surprisingly, the human genome is highly responsive to changes in our societal status, consequently culminating in elevated risk of chronic diseases. We leverage on the data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), a nationally representative sample of over 4000 adults in the United States. My research at the Social Genomics team specifically focuses on:

Socioeconomic inequalities predict many chronic diseases of aging {% cite Shanahan2022 %}. Drawing on a bioinformatically - informed network approach, I explore the ramifications of inequalities on molecular underpinning of chronic diseases, aging and immune dysregulation. Furthermore, I examine the role of social and behavioural risk factors in mediating these associations. In our latest work, we showcase a network of differentially expressed genes, transcription factors and protein neighbors responsible for widespread SES-related immune dysregulation {% cite Ravi2024 %}.

Emerging research documents the significant association between socioeconomic status (SES) and indicators of metabolic health: for example, higher SES is associated with improved metabolic control, reduced incidence of diabetes complications, and improved cardiovascular health. In fact, a considerable body of evidence suggests a link between socioeconomic disparities and risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS), a cluster of physiological and biochemical disorders that includes elevated fasting glucose, high blood pressure, dyslipidemia, and abdominal obesity. Our analysis revealed a repression of the cellular carbohydrate and energy metabolism in adults with low socioeconomic positions, particularly in metabolic flux profiles in the glycolysis, citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. Besides the cellular energetic crisis, our results further showed disruptions in the amino acid and lipid metabolic pathways. Interestingly, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases have also been linked to a repression in cellular energy generation. Thus, our results link metabolic perturbation to socioeconomic inequalities and subsequently to risk of metabolic syndrome.
