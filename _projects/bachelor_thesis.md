As part of joint program between [SASTRA University](https://scbt.sastra.edu) and [Harvard-MIT Health Sciences and Technology](https://hst.mit.edu), I completed my Bachelor thesis under [Dr. Aaron Goldman](https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/96642) in [Laboratory for Nanomedicine](https://web.mit.edu/shiladit/www/Lab/index.html). The thesis titled, "*An Induced CD44v6 – EGFR scaffold kinase interaction predisposes a subpopulation of chemotherapy tolerant breast cancer cells and serves as a bi-valent target of resistance*" explores 
the physical interaction of Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) with CD44v6 which renders a subpopulation of chemotherapy tolerant cells
sensitive to treatment. A novel bi-specific targeting of CD44v6-EGFR scaffold kinase interaction leads a innovative treatment for relapse in
breast cancer.
