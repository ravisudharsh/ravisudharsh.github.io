My research interests include integrative omics and multiomics analysis. Despite its challenges, multiomic analysis is crucial for advancing our understanding of complex biological systems and diseases. It holds the promise of revolutionizing healthcare by enabling more precise diagnoses, personalized treatments, and the development of more effective drugs.

In one such effort{% cite Parmentier2022 %}, we collaborated with [Prof. Andràs Paldi](https://www.ephe.psl.eu/andras-paldi) at [École Pratique des Hautes Études, Paris, France](https://www.ephe.psl.eu/) to integrate single-cell RNA sequencing data with ATAC-seq in understanding the activate of gene expression as an important first step before human hematopoietic cells commit to differentiation.
