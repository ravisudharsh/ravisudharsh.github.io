## About me
I am a Bioinformatics specialist at a <a href="{{ '/startup/' | relative_url }}">Stealth startup</a> in Zürich, Switzerland. Prior to my current position, I was a Post-doctoral research associate in [Social Genomics](https://www.jacobscenter.uzh.ch/en/research/social_genomics.html) at the [Jacobs Center for Productive Youth Development, UZH Zürich](https://www.jacobscenter.uzh.ch/en.html). I earned my doctoral degree from ETH, Zürich in Chemical and Bioengineering with a focus on Systems Biology. I had the opportunity to experience University at Buffalo, New York as a visiting researcher when our lab, [CABSEL](https://engineering.buffalo.edu/chemical-biological/people/faculty-directory/core.host.html/content/shared/engineering/chemical-biological/profiles/faculty/gunawan-rudiyanto.detail.html) moved in 2018. My pre-doctoral academic career includes a Masters degree at ETH, Zürich and research stints at Harvard - MIT Health Sciences and Technology affiliated laboratories exploring mechanisms of chemotherapy tolerance in breast cancer cells. 

My <a href="{{ '/research/' | relative_url }}">research</a> focuses on the investigation of metabolic networks and its application in understanding the biology of human aging and age-related diseases. Through the development of algorithms designed to predict metabolic perturbations with the incorporation of differential transcriptomic data, I strive to shed light on the biological roadmap of events in the aging and neurodegenerative processes. My interest encompass integrative omics analysis, particularly in human diseases.

During my <a href="{{ '/research/social_genomics/' | relative_url }}">post-doctoral research</a>, I investigated the impact of socio-economic and other exogenous gradients on transcriptional and methylation patterns in humans, and consequently its implications in phenotypical modulations. **Currently**, I am embracing an exciting new chapter as a Bioinformatics Specialist at a <a href="{{ '/startup/' | relative_url }}">Stealth startup</a>, diving into ambitious projects at the intersection of bioinformatics and cutting-edge innovation.
