## About me
I am a Post-doctoral researcher in [Social Genomics](https://www.jacobscenter.uzh.ch/en/research/social_genomics.html) at the [Jacobs Center for Productive Youth Development, UZH Z端rich](https://www.jacobscenter.uzh.ch/en.html). Prior to my current position, I obtained my doctoral degree from ETH, Z端rich in Chemical and Bioengineering with a focus on Systems Biology. I had the opportunity to experience the University at Buffalo, New York as a visiting researcher when our lab, [CABSEL](https://www.cabselab.com) moved in 2018. My pre-doctoral academic career includes a Masters degree at ETH, Z端rich and research stints at Harvard - MIT Health Sciences and Technology affliated laboratories exploring mechanisms of chemotherapy tolerance in breast cancer cells. 

My research focuses on the investigation of metabolic networks and its application in understanding the biology of human aging and age-related diseases. Through the development of algorithms designed to predict metabolic perturbations with the incorporation of differential transcriptomic data, I strive to shed shed light on the biological roadmap of events in the aging and neurodegenerative processes. My interests encompass integrative omics analysis, particularly in human diseases.

**Currently**, I investigate the impact of socio-economic gradients on transcriptional and methylation patterns in humans, and consequently its implications in phenotypical modulations.
